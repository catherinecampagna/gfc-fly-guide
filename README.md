# gfc-fly-guide
Final Project CB-WD-23

Gasp√© Fly Company is a Canadian company specialized in manufacturing and distributing premium quality fishing flies. They have thousands of flies in their catalog, so it can be difficult for beginners to know what to buy for their next fishing trip.

The purpose of the Fly Guide is to offer an interactive sorting solution, sifting through GFC's Top Flies, offering personalized fly recommendations and allowing users to review flies and save their favourites.
